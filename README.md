# LOIN-for-Lighting-Simulation

This repository supports the thesis project **"Lifting Heterogeneous Data into RDF/OWL Knowledge Graph: A Semantic Approach"** conducted as part of the Master's program in Sustainable Building Information Management at J√∂nk√∂ping University.

## üß† Project Summary

The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry suffers from poor data interoperability during cross-domain integration of diverse data & sources across multiple project stakeholders in a project. Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data Principles are seen as a solution to address these issues by transforming the data into a machine-interpretable format. This project looks into the transformation of heterogeneous data into RDF/OWL data using a semantic approach. It utilizes Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles to tackle the interoperability issue by:

- Extracting lighting product data.
- Structuring and sharing it using the **LOIN (Level of Information Need)** methodology.
- Receiving simulation results or specification data.
- Validating it against **Information Delivery Specifications (IDS)**.

## üîç Objectives

1. Extract lighting data from RDF-based dictionaries.
2. Package and deliver it using LOIN and Data Templates.
3. Support semantic validation with IDS against received data.
4. Use SPARQL / SHACL for advanced querying and reasoning.

## üîó Key Standards and Ontologies

- **Level of Information Need (LOIN) Ontology** ‚Äì Defines level of information need. <https://w3id.org/loin>
- **Data Template Ontology (TempO)** ‚Äì Used for data templates and property definition. <https://w3id.org/tempo>
- **ISO 23386 Property Ontology (ISOProps)** ‚Äì  Describing, creating, and maintenance of properties in interconnected data dictionaries. <https://w3id.org/isoprops>
- **Lighting Product Property Ontology (LPPO)** ‚Äì Data dictionary for the properties describing electric lighting products and luminaires and sensing devices used in the construction. <http://www.w3id.org/ppon/lppo>

## üöÄ Technologies & Tools

- **RDF / OWL** ‚Äì Knowledge representation.
- **Prot√©g√©** ‚Äì Ontology design and alignment.
- **Python (rdflib / Stardog RDF Grammars)** ‚Äì RDF transformation and automation. / Visual Studio Code syntax highlighting for all your favorite RDF languages, and a few Stardog-specific ones, too!
- **SPARQL / SHACL** ‚Äì Semantic querying.
- **GraphDB / Stardog** ‚Äì Triplestore and query execution.
- **LOIN XML and IDS** ‚Äì Specification and validation exchange format.

## üõ† Use Case

The example use case involves sharing lighting data from a manufacturer with an architect:

1. Extract and transform product data into RDF using a predefined ontology.
2. Package the data using the LOIN approach and share it with an architect.
3. Architect selects or/and simulates lighting parameters and returns data.
4. The data is validated against predefined IDS rules using SHACL or SPARQL.
